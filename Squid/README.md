# Squid
This is a simple custom squid configuration file I edited.

To edit this file, jump to line 1411. You can edit the port number, add rules and set it up.

The file is blocking websites in the /etc/squid/blacklist file, you can put any website you want to block there. (Just make sure to create the blacklist file using touch or a text editor)

In the blacklist file, don't include http:// or https:// just use "www.website.com"
